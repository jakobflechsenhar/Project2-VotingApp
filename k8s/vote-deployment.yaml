# Kubernetes Deployment: Vote App
#--------------------------------------------------------#
# Vote app deployment creates 2 replicas that connect to Redis for storing votes.
# Deployment uses a custom Docker image that must be built and pushed to Docker Hub (which is done in workflows file, i.e. in the GitHub Actions file).
# Service exposes the vote app internally on port 80 for other services to connect.
